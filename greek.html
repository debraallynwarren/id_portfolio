			<p>This project was the development of an online 5 week &quot;Bootcamp Classic Greek&quot; course.&nbsp; It was a collaborative project that included the main instructor who was in California, the Teaching Assistant who was in the Boulder area, the Instructional Designer/Media Production Manager in our department&nbsp;and me, the Lead Instructional Designer.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Media Production Manager worked with the instructor to record videos for the course and then I worked with the instructor and the Media Production Manager to layout the course and build it.&nbsp; I also trained the instructor and the Teaching Assistant on how to use the learning management system and troubleshoot issues during the semester.</p>
			<p>This course has been taught the last two summers and will be taught again this summer.&nbsp; It is a template course and a new instructor will teach the course this&nbsp;summer and will make minor edits to the existing content.&nbsp; </p>

                    <p>This is the layout for course content.&nbsp; With the intense pace of the course, it is formatted so students have to complete certain tasks each day of the week. </p>

                     <p>This is an example of a lecture video and the assignments for this day.&nbsp;Videos are embedded in html pages and are hosted on a system server.&nbsp; </p>
