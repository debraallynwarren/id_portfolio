      <p>An Instructional Designer who loves a challenge, I enjoy helping people discover  they can accomplish a lot more than they thought they could and I try to make learning new process and skills as painless as possible. I currently am creating courses with tenure faculty, GPTI instructors and adjuct instructors. </p>
      <p>Some of the projects  I've worked on include  developing job aids, designing and creating processes for a variety of subjects including an online Speech course, an online Russian language course, online Ancient Greek language courses and an online dance course.&nbsp; I have developed and implemented processes for adding measurable objectives to a development process, planned and implement a migration from one learning management system to another learning management system, and revision of processes because of continued growth of an online program. I have experience using a wide range of technologies and like to try new approaches and technologies.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>When I work with content experts or work on projects, I think that technology should be invisible so that the focus is on learning. Instruction should provide people with tools and skills that will help them be successful.</p>
      <p>Planning and establishing objectives is a key part of developing instructional materials, but you also have to be ready to make adjustments if a plan isn't work or if the situation changes. </p>
      <p>I try to keep things simple and look for ways that I can keep learning and apply what I learn in original ways. I feel that it is important focus on what you really want to accomplish on a project and those objectives should drive the direction and decisions throughout the entire project.&nbsp;</p>
