			<p>This project was the development of our first online dance course.&nbsp;&nbsp;During development and the first semester it was taught, the instructor was in Montana in a dance troupe, in the Boulder area, and then she moved to New York City. </span></p>
			<p>The course was developed to be inline with the face-to-face version of this course and includes videos of different dance styles.&nbsp;			</p>

            <p>An important factor of this course was consistency between units.&nbsp;When courses have a lot of content and have an intense pace, it is important for content to have a consistent layout so students know what to expect and they can plan how to complete the required assignments.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The overview page explained the content that would be included in each unit.&nbsp; Each unit included videos, pdfs and threaded discussions and every&nbsp;assignment had due dates so students moved through the content at the same pace. </p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Videos were included in the content as demonstrations of different types of dance.&nbsp; Below are some of the videos included in unit 1. </p>
